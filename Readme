***Introduction**
Welcome to my server!

Due to system dependencies, my program does not run on the gradescope. 
It is working on my device, but there is a few dependencies. 

1. Ports are finicky in def init_serv_sock(port)
  135 serv_sock.bind(("", port))'
  If the this doesn't work:
  Comment it and uncomment'
  136 serv_sock.bind('0.0.0.0', port))'
  or' 
  137 serv_sock.bind((socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()), port))'

2. Execute the server using: 
  python assignment3.py -l 12345 -p "happy"
then on a seperate terminal run:'
  nc localhost 1234 -i <delay> < file.txt'
  or'
  nc -v localhost 1234 -i <delay> < file.txt
  '

Note: I need a cli_sock.settimeout(10) to end the recv loop. 
Hence, change that according to the time of the repeat. 

Cheers!
